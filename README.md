# FCEUX-lua-scripts
This repository stores all the scripts I made for FCEUX NES emulator. Make sure that you have the newest version of the emulator before you try to use them. Also, any attempt to use the script on the game, which is not designed for it may produce anomalies, or in worst case, even crash the game, you've loaded right now

Summary of scripts added so far:

## Jeopardy! Keyboard Input ##

This script changes the way you input player names and the answer while you play Jeopardy! for the NES on the FCEUX emulator. 

<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> - clears the input

<kbd>Enter</kbd> - confirms the input

The script will clear the excessive characters if you happen to type too fast while hitting the limit of available characters.
