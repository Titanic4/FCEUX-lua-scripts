# FCEUX-lua-scripts
This repository stores all the scripts I made for FCEUX NES emulator. Make sure that you have the newest version of the emulator before you try to use them. Also, any attempt to use the script on the game, which is not designed for it may produce anomalies, or in worst case, even crash the game, you've loaded right now
